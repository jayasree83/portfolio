									<h2>Workflow Orchestration with Airflow and AWS</h2>
									<p>The goal of this project is to build an <b>end-to-end data pipeline</b> that securely connects, manages, streamlines, and analyzes data generated from the Rapid API. The pipeline extracts data for a given location in JSON format, transforms it, and stores it in AWS for further analysis. The entire workflow is orchestrated in Airflow which is set up in <b>virtual environment on EC2 instance</b>. This project repository contains Airflow <b>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</b> designed to automate the process of fetching property data from the Rapid API, processing it, and loading it into Amazon <i>S3</i> and <i>Redshift</i> for further analysis. The DAG defines an end-to-end workflow, starting from extracting data via API requests to performing checks and loading the data into AWS S3 and Redshift for analytical purposes.</p>
